        * Here I created a README generator using writeFile and axios functions. first i created const variables to require fs, axios, and inquirer
       then i made type and input methods for each part of the github input such as github username, github email, project description, project title, project installation,
       and contribution. Then i created a writeToFile function for fileName and data also a variable for the template. I then created a writeFile function for
       fileName, template, and function(err) and an if and throw statement. Created a template literal for github username through the github API and console
       logged the response. Made an inquirer prompt to ask the questions related to github and github projects as well as a response to retrieve the github profile
